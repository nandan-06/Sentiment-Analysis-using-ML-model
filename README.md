![Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)

- Main focus was to consider the emotes as well in the dataset. Therefore we have converted the emotes to texts and then applied the preprocessing (i.e. - Lemmetization and Vectorization)
- For the above task, library used is `demoji`.
- Models applied for training - Logistic Regression and Bernoulli Classification model.
